### Senior Design Project Implementation

PLEASE NOTE
* Follow Notebooks in order of numbering
* Pay attention to when 'train' or 'test' is needed
* ArabSign Dataset must be extracted as is with folders 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, and 06 found in an outer folder 'ArabSign Datast'
* Then, the saved grayscales and resulting ATD stacked frames should be of resolution 960x540
* They can be cropped to 540x540 then resized either to 299x299 (for inceptionV3) or 300x300 (for DCT)
* If they are not resized to 300x300 for dct, the dct function will automatically pad (however performance will be worse)
